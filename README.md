# APIs Level 3

In this challenge you will build an app using a public API of your choosing that fetches data from the API and displays it in an visually appealing way to demonstrate your skills in APIs.


## Requirements

In order for the project to be considered "completed", it must complete the following requirements:

1. **Fetching Data:** fetches data from an API and renders the results in a table with paging
   
2. **Frontend:** displays data of your choice from the table in the frontend portion of your app

3. **Git Best Practices:** hides all API Keys and secrets in a `.env` file and uses a `.gitignore` to prevent all unneccessary files from being added to the GitHub Repository

## Example

See the following source code [here](https://github.com/catherinel04/Pokedex/tree/main) for an example that achieves the goals of this project!
